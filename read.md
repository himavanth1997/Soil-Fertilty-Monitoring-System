		Sandy soil – are light, warm, dry and tend to be acidic and low in nutrients. Sandy soils are often known as light soils due to their high proportion of sand and little clay (clay weighs more than sand). These soils have quick water drainage and are easy to work with. They are quicker to warm up in spring than clay soils but tend to dry out in summer and suffer from low nutrients that are washed away by rain. The addition of organic matter can help give plants an additional boost of nutrients by improving the nutrient and water holding capacity of the soil.

		Clay soil – are heavy soils that benefit from high nutrients. Clay soils remain wet and cold in winter and dry out in summer. These soils are made of over 25 percent clay, and because of the spaces found between clay particles, clay soils hold a high amount of water. Because these soils drain slowly and take longer to warm up in summer, combined with drying out and cracking in summer, they can often test gardeners.
..
		Silt soil – are light and moisture retentive soils with a high fertility rating. As silt soils compromise of medium sized particles they are well drained and hold moisture well. As the particles are fine, they can be easily compacted and are prone to washing away with rain. By adding organic matter, the silt particles can be bound into more stable clumps.
..
		Peat soil – are high in organic matter and retain a large amount of moisture. This type of soil is very rarely found in a garden and often imported into a garden to provide an optimum soil base for planting.
..
		Chalk soil – can be either light or heavy but always highly alkaline due to the calcium carbonate or lime within its structure. As these soils are alkaline they will not support the growth of ericaceous plants that require acidic soils to grow. If a chalky soil shows signs of visible white lumps then they can’t be acidified and gardeners should be resigned to only choose plants that prefer an alkaline soil.
..
		Loam soil – are a mixture of sand, silt and clay that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each type. These soils are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. Depending on their predominant composition they can be either sandy or clay loam. As the soils are a perfect balance of soil particles, they are considered to be a gardeners best friend, but still benefit from topping up with additional organic matter.
 
Soil testing
Soil testing is often performed by commercial labs that offer a variety of tests, targeting groups of compounds and minerals. The advantages associated with local lab is that they are familiar with the chemistry of the soil in the area where the sample was taken. This enables technicians to recommend the tests that are most likely to reveal useful information.


Soil testing in progress
Laboratory tests often check for plant nutrients in three categories:

Major nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
Secondary nutrients: sulfur, calcium, magnesium
Minor nutrients: iron, manganese, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine
The amount of plant available soil phosphorus is most often measured with a chemical extraction method, and different countries have different standard methods. Just in Europe, more than 10 different soil P tests are currently in use and the results from these tests are not directly comparable with each other[2].


Soil Fertility And Productivity

Soil fertility:
         is the capacity/ability of the soil to supply the plant nutrients required by the crop plants in available and 
balanced forms. Or 
It is the capacity of soil to produce crops of economic value to man and maintain the health of the soil for future use.
The soil is said to be fertile when it contains all the required nutrients in the right proportion for luxuriant plant growth.

Plants like animals and human beings require food for growth and development. This food is composed of certain chemical elements
often referred to as plant nutrients or plant food elements. These nutrients are obtained from soil through roots.
Plants need 16 elements for their growth and completion of life cycle. In addition to these, 4 more elements viz. sodium, 
vanadium, cobalt and silicon are absorbed by some plants for special purposes.

Classification and source of nutrients:
Class                    Nutrient                                      Source 
Basic                    C, H, O                                     Air and water
Macro                  N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S                     Soil
Micro                   Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo & CI     Soil
Four more recognized nutrients are NA, Co, VA & SI.

Basic nutrients (C, H, and O) constitute 96% of total dry matter of plants. 
Macro (Major) nutrients (primary-N, P, K, and secondary-Ca, Mg, S) are required in large quantities while Micro 
nutrients(Trace elements-Fe, Zn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl, and Mn) are required in small quantities. These trace elements are very efficient
and minute quantities produce optimum effect. On the other hand, even a slight deficiency or excess is harmful to plants.
