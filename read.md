Soil Fertility And Productivity

Soil fertility:
         is the capacity/ability of the soil to supply the plant nutrients required by the crop plants in available and 
balanced forms. Or 
It is the capacity of soil to produce crops of economic value to man and maintain the health of the soil for future use.
The soil is said to be fertile when it contains all the required nutrients in the right proportion for luxuriant plant growth.

Plants like animals and human beings require food for growth and development. This food is composed of certain chemical elements
often referred to as plant nutrients or plant food elements. These nutrients are obtained from soil through roots.
Plants need 16 elements for their growth and completion of life cycle. In addition to these, 4 more elements viz. sodium, 
vanadium, cobalt and silicon are absorbed by some plants for special purposes.

Classification and source of nutrients:
Class                    Nutrient                                      Source 
Basic                    C, H, O                                     Air and water
Macro                  N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S                     Soil
Micro                   Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo & CI     Soil
Four more recognized nutrients are NA, Co, VA & SI.

Basic nutrients (C, H, and O) constitute 96% of total dry matter of plants. 
Macro (Major) nutrients (primary-N, P, K, and secondary-Ca, Mg, S) are required in large quantities while Micro 
nutrients(Trace elements-Fe, Zn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl, and Mn) are required in small quantities. These trace elements are very efficient
and minute quantities produce optimum effect. On the other hand, even a slight deficiency or excess is harmful to plants.
